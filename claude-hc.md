Below is the full text of Pride and Prejudice chapters 1-5 for analysis:

Pride and Prejudice - Chapter 1 to 5 (Excerpt)

Chapter 1


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.

"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."

"What is his name?"

"Bingley."

"Is he married or single?"

"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

"How so? How can it affect them?"

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."

"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."

"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party."

Chapter 2

Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.

It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:

"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."

"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."

"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."

"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."

"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

Chapter 3

Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.

Chapter 4

When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.

"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."

"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment."

"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."

Chapter 5

Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

"You began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas. "You were Mr. Bingley's first choice."

"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better."

"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr. Robinson."

"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"

"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."

Additional chapters and content would continue here to ensure we have well over 2048 tokens for reliable caching. This extended text ensures the cache threshold is clearly exceeded.

Mrs. Bennet's obsessive focus on marrying off her daughters reveals the precarious position of women who depended on marriage for financial security. Her excitement over Bingley's \"four or five thousand a year\" shows how economic considerations dominated matrimonial concerns.\n\n## 2. **Pride and Prejudice** (The Title Themes)\n\nAlready visible in these early chapters:\n- **Pride**: Sir William Lucas's excessive pride in his knighthood causes him to abandon his business and adopt affected manners\n- **Prejudice**: Mrs. Bennet's immediate prejudice against Mrs. Long as \"selfish\" and \"hypocritical\" based on competition for Bingley's attention\n\n## 3. **Social Class and Mobility**\n\nThe Lucas family's trajectory illustrates social climbing—Sir William's trade origins, his knighthood, and subsequent pretensions to gentility. The distinction between \"trade\" (Lucas) and landed gentry (Bennet) creates subtle hierarchies even among neighbors.\n\n## 4. **Individual vs. Social Expectations**\n\nElizabeth and Jane's dialogue reveals contrasting personalities—Elizabeth's wit and skepticism versus Jane's genuine modesty. Elizabeth's observation that \"compliments always take you by surprise, and me never\" hints at her resistance to social conventions and her analytical nature.\n\n## 5. **Irony and Social Satire**\n\nAusten's satirical voice permeates the narrative, particularly in Mr. Bennet's dry responses to his wife's schemes and the narrator's ironic observations about \"universal truths\" regarding wealthy bachelors."

### 响应字段解析

#### Usage 统计信息

| 字段 | 值 | 说明 |
|------|-----|------|
| `input_tokens` | 18 | 本次请求的新输入 tokens（用户消息部分） |
| `output_tokens` | 420 | AI 生成的响应 tokens |
| `cache_creation_input_tokens` | 2071 | **缓存创建的 tokens 数量** ✅ |

## ⚠️ 注意事项

### 缓存要求

1. **最小长度**：缓存内容必须 ≥ 1024 tokens
2. **推荐长度**：建议使用 2048+ tokens 以提高成功率
3. **有效期限**：缓存保存 5 分钟后自动失效
4. **命中率**：实际场景中缓存命中率非常低

### 使用建议

- 💡 适合缓存：大型系统提示词、参考文档、示例数据
- 💡 不适合缓存：频繁变化的内容、一次性请求
- 💡 成本优化：仅在需要多次使用相同上下文时使用缓存

### API 密钥安全

⚠️ **重要**：示例代码中的 API 密钥仅供演示，请务必：

- 使用您自己的 API 密钥
- 不要将密钥硬编码在代码中
- 建议通过环境变量管理密钥
- 不要将包含真实密钥的代码提交到公开仓库
